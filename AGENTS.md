# AGENTS.md

This repository is authored and maintained with LLM assistance.

## Transparency

Design documents, ADRs, problem docs, and plans in this repo are drafted, expanded, and revised with the help of AI coding agents. Human review and editorial judgment govern all merged content.

Commits include an `Assisted-by` trailer when agent-assisted.

## Agent Instructions

This is a **docs-only** repo. No application code lives here — implementation is in separate repositories (see [architecture.md](docs/architecture.md#repositories)).

When contributing to this repo:

- **Follow the escalation model** in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md): Issue → Problem Doc → ADR → Plan.
- **Write for humans.** Active voice, no filler, bottom-line-up-front. Tables over paragraphs where data is structured.
- **Problem docs explore; ADRs decide.** Do not mix exploration with decisions. If the answer is uncertain, it belongs in `docs/problems/`. If it's settled, write an ADR.
- **ADRs are immutable.** Never edit an accepted ADR. Supersede it with a new one.
- **Keep the sidebar current.** Update `docs/_sidebar.md` when adding new documents.
- **Link new docs in the README.** The "What's here" section in `README.md` is the entry point.
- **Problem docs have no decisions.** Problem docs may contain "Proposed approaches" for exploration, but settled decisions must be extracted to ADRs before merge. Sections titled "Decisions", "Settled questions", or "Resolution status" in problem docs are a review blocker.
- **One logical change per PR.** Do not bundle unrelated document changes. If a problem exploration leads to a decision, the decision goes in a chained ADR PR, not the same PR.
- **Chain PRs for problem → ADR pairs.** The problem doc PR targets main. The ADR PR targets the problem doc branch. GitHub shows the dependency. Reviewers can approve the problem doc independently.
- **Evidence semantics belong in Gemara.** Problem docs describe *why* evidence is hard. Schema-level semantics (freshness models, confidence descriptors, envelope schemas) belong in the Gemara repository, not in problem docs.
- **Vendor-neutral problem statements.** Problem docs describe approaches generically. Specific vendor/product names belong in "Current approaches / prior art" sections, not in proposed approaches.

### Document Formatting

When a document type has a template, use **only** the headings defined in that template. Do not invent, extend, rename, or omit required headings. The template is the single source of truth for document structure — including which sections are required, which are optional, and what content constraints apply to each.

**ADRs** follow the [MADR 4.0 template](docs/ADRs/adr-template.md). The template marks optional sections explicitly; all other sections are required. Remove optional sections entirely rather than leaving them empty. Do not add headings not present in the template.

**Problem docs** use a suggested structure (see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)) but are not template-bound. Headings may vary to suit the exploration.
